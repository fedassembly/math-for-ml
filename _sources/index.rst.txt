Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science 
=================================================

Notes from DeepLearning.ai's course `Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science>`_ taught by Luis Serrano from Coursera.

⚠️ These are not the official notebooks from the course. 

Although I was largely inspired by the course, I've also used other sources like Khan Academy, Wikipedia to name a few.

I've also included some extra content like PCA and SVM from scratch, the actual implementation of back-propagation (credit: `Deep Learning Specialization <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning>`_), the relationship between Newton's method and Taylor series, the Lagrange multiplier method, etc.

I did not include notes on statistics because it's a topic I didn't need to refresh as much as linear algebra and calculus.
