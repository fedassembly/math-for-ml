Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science 
=================================================

These are my notes from DeepLearning.ai's course `Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science?>`_ taught by Luis Serrano from Coursera.

These are not the official notebooks from the course. These are my personal notes.
